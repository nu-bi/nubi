# OUTSTANDING — Nubi implement-and-audit tracker

Drives the 15-min autonomous loop (cron `53cae62f`, started 2026-06-11). Each
iteration: pick the top unchecked item → implement properly with disjoint-file
agents → verify (backend pytest + `npm run build` + mcp pytest) → commit green →
update this file. **Never leave the tree red.**

Baseline at audit: commit `16f31d0` (Wave C). Waves A/B/C done. Verify commands:
- backend: `cd backend && python -m pytest -q`
- frontend: `npm run build`
- mcp: `cd mcp && python -m pytest -q`

## P0 — critical path

- [x] **Wave D1 — real provider tool-use loop** (`app/ai/agent.py`, `tools.py`): iterative
  tool loop + `list_metrics`/`query_metric` governed tools, RLS via claims. ✅ `47e5556`.
- [x] **Wave D2 — ask→pin** (`POST /ai/pin`, `routes/ai.py`): answer→validated widget,
  structured-error validation, append-or-create board. ✅ `47e5556`.
- [x] **Wave D3 — watch** (`app/ai/watch.py`, `routes/watches.py`, `0009_watches.sql`):
  metric threshold → AI explanation (deterministic under NullProvider) → notify channel;
  CRUD + `/evaluate` + `/tick`. ✅ `47e5556` (backend 3405 / mcp 67 / build green).
- [x] **Wave E1 — Redis cache + invalidation** (`app/connectors/cache.py`, `app/cache/redis_client.py`,
  `routes/cache.py`, `ratelimit.py`): pluggable Redis backend + tag invalidation + `/cache/stats` +
  `/cache/invalidate`; rate-limiter uses an atomic Redis token-bucket when REDIS_URL is set (fixes the
  multi-machine gap), in-process fallback otherwise. ✅ `04d2ce1` (backend 3428 passed).
- [ ] **Wave E4 — headless preview** (`GET /boards/{id}/preview.png?env=dev`): ⚠️ BLOCKED on an
  infra decision — Playwright is NOT installed (only system Chrome present), and a *proper* render
  needs (a) a browser binary in the prod image, (b) serving the built frontend so charts (echarts/JS)
  actually paint, (c) a short-lived internal embed token to auth the render. Don't ship a layout-only
  stub. Needs a infra/dependency call before implementing — deferred past widget-binding.

## P1 — high value

- [x] **usage_events(org_id, created_at) index** — ✅ already exists (`0006_platform.sql:53`);
  audit false-positive. No action.
- [x] **Wave E2 — SLOs/observability**: in-process latency percentiles (`app/observability/`),
  `LatencyMiddleware`, `GET /ops/stats`, `docs/observability.md` with published SLO targets +
  documented rate limits. ✅ `df41c15` (backend 3455). *Follow-up:* cross-process aggregation.
- [x] **Wave E3 — compliance posture**: `docs/compliance.md` — honest SOC 2 / POPIA / GDPR
  posture mapping real controls (planner RLS, AES-256-GCM/Fernet at rest, HttpOnly cookies,
  CASCADE erasure) + an explicit gap list (DPA, sub-processor list, IR runbook, pen-test) +
  sub-processors. Not a certification claim. ✅ (docs-only).
- [x] **Widget→metric binding** (Wave C "later"): `Widget.metric` binding (metric_id + dims/grain
  + filters) in `dashboards/spec.py`; `runMetricQuery` + Chart/Table/Kpi widgets fetch from
  `/metrics/{id}/query`; `/ai/pin` metric path. ✅ `7f4434a` (backend 3442, build green).
  *Follow-up:* embed web-component (`<nubi-chart metric-id=…>`) consumption of the emitted attrs.
- [~] **Landing-page glow-up** (`src/pages/LandingPage.jsx`, `src/components/illustrations/*`):
  orchestrator-driven visual loop. The "long text / no bold / bland" complaint is now substantively
  addressed: hero copy tightened + scannable bold (`43404db`); bold emphasis across the section
  intros — in-action, "eight decisions", connectors, about (`9f240c2`). Both verified rendered.
  OPTIONAL remaining (nice-to-have; the SVG illustrations are already decent): replace the generic
  dashboard mockups in the "in action" section with REAL app screenshots (needs demo-workspace
  login + navigate + capture) — lower priority than P2 correctness items.
- [x] **Estimate quota footgun** — `/query/estimate` charged a FULL compute unit (== a real
  query) while its docstring claimed "a small dry-run budget"; an auto-refreshing estimate UI
  could drain the execution quota. Now charges `0.05` units. ✅ (pending verify+commit).
- [⊘] **B2 stale-snapshot** — DEFERRED (needs an architecture decision, not a blind edit on
  just-B2-fixed runtime code). Policies live ONLY in the JWT (`claims["policies"]`), so there's
  no server-side per-user policy source to re-derive at tick time. The only server-detectable
  sub-case is owner-membership revocation, but the flows execution/test path has no reliable
  membership signal (fail-closed-on-`None` would break flow tests that don't seed `org_members`).
  A proper fix = a server-side per-user RLS-policy store (re-derive at tick) OR a flow "service
  identity" model. Tracked for a deliberate design pass.
- [ ] **Hot-path SQL re-parse** (P1, partial): `planner.py` registry short-circuit already added;
  remaining: thread the parsed AST from `planner.plan` into `route_to_rollup_shape`/query-log so
  a cache-MISS query parses once, not 2–3×.

## P2 — follow-ups

- [ ] **Real scanned-bytes counters**: replace the Arrow-IPC-length proxy in `routes/query.py`
  with DuckDB post-pruning byte counters (parquet_metadata/httpfs) before `$5/TiB` is a public price.
- [ ] **Legacy `app/git/remote.py` argv-token push** (B5 low): delete/refactor to askpass like
  `remotes.py`; add a CI grep guard against `user:token@`/`git push <authed_url>` in argv.
- [ ] **FlyMachineExecutor wake/sleep** (`app/compute/serverless_exec.py`): real Fly Machines
  API wake/sleep (default HeavyPoolExecutor already works; this is explicit control).
- [ ] **Lakehouse optimizer deeper bits** (`app/lakehouse/optimizer.py`): write rollups to R2
  Parquet (not local DuckDB), auto incremental refresh, HLL/t-digest sketches.
- [ ] **Real-remote git push/pull verification** for the PAT/askpass path (needs a live remote;
  can't fully automate — document a manual test).
- [ ] **Provider model routing** (`routes/ai.py` TODO): thread the requested model through to
  the provider/agent.
- [ ] **Dashboard variable URL sync** (`DashboardViewPage.jsx` TODO M14-C-sync): URLSyncProvider.
